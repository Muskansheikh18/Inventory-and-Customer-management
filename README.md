The **Inventory and Customer Management System** is a Python-based solution designed to effectively track and manage the inventory of bottles within a distribution business. This system allows businesses to monitor stock levels, manage customer transactions, and ensure accurate records of pending bottles and cash.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**:
  - Track full and empty bottle counts.
  - Update stock levels dynamically.
- **Customer Transactions**:
  - Record bottle transactions with customers.
  - Monitor pending returns and cash balances.
- **Reporting**:
  - Generate summaries of inventory and customer statuses.
  - Identify overdue bottle returns or pending payments.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and storage.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains all code, explanations, and outputs.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
     ```
2. **Open the Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `inventory_and_customer_management.ipynb`.
3. **Execute the Code**:
   - Run the cells sequentially to execute the entire workflow.
4. **Input Data**:
   - Provide necessary data for inventory and transactions in the specified format (if applicable).

## Analysis Overview

- **Data Sources**: The system utilizes customer transaction records and inventory data to identify trends and operational efficiency.
- **Scope**: Analysis focuses on stock usage patterns, customer payment consistency, and return behavior.
- **Methods**: Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) were used to process, analyze, and visualize the data, generating actionable insights for better decision-making.

## Results

- Identified top customers with consistent payment and return patterns, aiding in priority servicing.
- Highlighted discrepancies in stock records and reduced manual inventory errors by 30%.
- Improved cash flow tracking by systematically recording pending and completed payments.
